.SH Description
.P
This script emulates the main features of [tdrop](https://github.\&com/noctuid/tdrop) in Hyprland:
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
if the specified program is not running: launch it and bring it to the foreground.\&
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
if the specified program is already running on another workspace: bring it to the current workspace and focus it.\&
.RE
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
if the specified program is already on the current workspace: move it to workspace '\&special:hdrop'\&, thereby hiding it until called up again by hdrop.\&

.RE
.P
.SH Multiple instances:
.P
Multiple instances of the same program can be run concurrently, if different class names are assigned to each instance.\& Presently there is support for the following flags in the [COMMAND] string:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
-a (\&'foot\&' terminal emulator)  
--class (all other programs)\&.
.fi
.RE
.P
.SH Example bindings in Hyprland config:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
bind = $mainMod, b, exec, hdrop librewolf\&'  
bind = $mainMod, x, exec, hdrop kitty --class kitty_1\&'  
bind = $mainMod CTRL, x, exec, hdrop kitty --class kitty_2\&'  
bind = $mainMod, c, exec, hdrop foot -a foot_1\&'  
bind = $mainMod CTRL, c, exec, hdrop foot -a foot_2\&'
.fi
.RE
.P
Note: defining a class name is only necessary when running several instances of the same program.\&
.P
If you want to run a program on boot and have it wait in the background until called up by hdrop you can use this:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
exec-once = hdrop -b librewolf
.fi
.RE
.P
Please feel free to report missing flags or peculiarities for other programs!\&
